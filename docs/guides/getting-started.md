# Getting Started

## Creating your first app

The easiest way to get started with Plasma FHIR is to use `create-plasma-app`. This will ask you a few questions about your app and then set you up with a template that you can start using immediately in the SMART Health IT sandbox.

```
npx create-plasma-app my-app
```
